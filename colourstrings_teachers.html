              <h2 class="greenH">Ingrid Sellschop</h2>
              <p>
                A graduate of the Royal Academy of Music, Ingrid Sellschop is
                the Principal of Cranbrook Colourstrings. She began her music
                studies in America at the age of eight and was fortunate enough
                to learn the violin with Irwin Eisenberg, of the Philadelphia
                String Quartet.&nbsp; Later, back in the UK she continued her
                studies with Vera Kantrovitch, Frederic Grinke, Clarence
                Myerscough, Jack Rosenberg, Nicholas Roth and Diana Cummings.
                The experience of learning with these respected pedagogues
                inspired Ingrid to specialise in teaching. Indeed, it has always
                felt like a vocation for her. She has successfully combined
                playing in many chamber orchestras with teaching in such schools
                as Kings Canterbury, Haberdashers Askes School for Girls,
                Dulwich Prep School, Benenden Girls School and the Kent Music
                Academy.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Ingrid discovered Colourstrings in 1995 she was immediately
                drawn to it and began training with Deborah Harris at the North
                London Colourstrings Centre. She was soon asked to join the
                staff there and taught Music Kindergarten and Violin for several
                years before moving to Kent. Not surprisingly, Ingrid missed her
                Colourstrings teaching and so in April 2005 Cranbrook
                Colourstrings evolved as a satellite school to the North London
                Colourstrings Centre. It now operates independently of the North
                London school and approximately 50 children currently enjoy the
                Music Kindergarten and instrumental programmes and Ingrid
                derives enormous pleasure from watching very young babies and
                children develop into such well-rounded musicians and confident,
                happy individuals.
              </p>
              <p>
                As well as attending two Colourstrings summer schools, Ingrid
                went to Finland last year to observe Colourstrings teaching at
                the school where it originated. She was able to sit in on
                lessons conducted by Géza Szilvay, who developed the
                Colourstrings method, and discuss teaching matters with him and
                his colleagues. To hear such wonderful teaching and music-making
                was truly inspirational!

                Felix Buser was born in Basle in Switzerland. He studied the
                cello at the Basle Konservatorium with Reine Flachot and Thomas
                Demenga and was awarded a specialist performer’s diploma. Whilst
                a student he took part in masterclasses in France and
                Switzerland, and in 1981 was invited to participate in special
                workshops at the Montepulciano Festival organised by Hans Werner
                Henze. Felix’s professional career has included work with the
                Basle Sinfonietta, the Schweizer Streichorchester and the
                Aargauer Symphonieorchester in Switzerland, as well as the
                chamber orchestra ‘La Follia’ in France. He was a member of both
                a string quartet and a piano trio in Basle which gave regular
                recitals throughout Switzerland. In 1990 he married a British
                violinist and is now resident in the UK where he follows a
                freelance career divided between teaching and performing with
                the emphasis on chamber music.

                Felix started his first teaching appointment while he was
                studying . In spite of his experience of having taught the cello
                in various countries for over 30 years he was instantly won over
                by colourstrings when he was introduced to it. As a result it
                has transformed his approach to teaching.

              <p>
                Ali Rycroft has been teaching music to young children since 2010
                through Colourstrings, a form of music education created in
                Finland by Geza Szilvay which follows the principles of the
                Hungarian composer and music educator Zoltán Kodály. Wonderful
                piano lessons as a teenager with Joyce Rathbone turned her
                musical world inside out and inspired her passion for music and
                teaching. Ali discovered Colourstrings when she took her
                children to classes in London and found in it a musical
                enchantment she would have loved as a young child. Ali holds
                degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of East
                London and is currently training in Dalcroze Eurythmics.
