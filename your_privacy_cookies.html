            />Both my children have attended the Cranbrook Colourstrings
            Kindergarten and are now on the instrumental programme. During their
            time in the Kindergarten they achieved a very high level of
            musicianship and are now rapidly transferring these skills onto
            their instruments with impressive results. They have grown in
            confidence in all areas of their academic and creative lives since
            starting at the Cranbrook Colourstrings School. I would highly
            recommend this teaching method to all parents of young children keen
            to learn an instrument. The students at the Cranbrook Colourstrings
            School receive tuition of the highest level and, equally important,
            the emotional guidance required to support their progress and
            achievements.<img
